# Maverick 🚀  

I don’t do “idle.” This space is where I drop experiments, sharpen tools, and test ideas in the open.  
It’s not polish over progress — it’s momentum you can see.  

---

## 🧭 What You’ll Find Here  
- Small projects that punch above their weight ⚡  
- Utilities, notebooks, and frameworks that prove a point fast  
- Documentation that’s clear enough for execs and sharp enough for builders  

---

## 🎬 Current Work  
- [myfirst-project](https://github.com/AndMaverick/myfirst-project) — my sandbox, the launchpad for what comes next  

---

## 🌱 Next Drops  
- Simple but useful scripts (automation, text analysis, everyday fixes)  
- A data exploration project (because insight > opinion)  
- Personal site on GitHub Pages — clean, bold, employer-ready  

---

## 🧩 Philosophy  
Ship fast. Learn loud. Keep it human.  

This isn’t a résumé — it’s the lab.  
Check back in a month and it won’t look the same.
